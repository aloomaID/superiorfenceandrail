                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Siler City began when Plikard Dederic Siler and his wife, Elizabeth Hartsoe Siler, settled about four miles north of the town's current location. They had met aboard the Two Sisters, a ship from Germany. The ship landed in Philadelphia, where Plikard paid leaf tobacco to marry Elizabeth. The couple briefly lived in Pennsylvania, then Virginia, and then settled near Lacy's Creek (the location near today's Siler City). They had ten children.</p>
