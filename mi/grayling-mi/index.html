                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>The city is located in the middle of the Northern Michigan region at the junctions of Interstate 75, U.S. Route 127, M-72, and M-93. Grayling is well known for hosting the Au Sable River Canoe Marathon in July of every year since 1947. The city is named after the Grayling species of fish once abundant in the Au Sable River, although the species has been extirpated in Michigan since 1936. There have been many attempts to bring Grayling back to the area but none have been successful.</p>
