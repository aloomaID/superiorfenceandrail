            <h3>Negaunee, MI Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Negaunee (/nəˈɡɔːni/ nə-GAW-nee or locally /ˈnəˈɡɒni/ nə-GAH-nee) is a city in Marquette County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 4,627 at the 2020 census. The city is located at the southwest corner of Negaunee Township, which is administratively separate, in the Upper Peninsula. The city is home to a luge track. The name 'Negaunee' comes from an Anishinabemowin (Ojibwe) word nigani, meaning 'foremost, in advance, leading,' which was determined to be the closest Ojibwe translation for 'pioneer'. Within the city limits is Teal Lake.</p>
