            <h3>Mckee City, NJ Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>McKee City is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) located near the Mays Landing section of Hamilton Township in Atlantic County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The community was named after Colonel John McKee (1821–1902), an African American property speculator. Although its name includes the word 'city', McKee City is not an actual city — it is currently a crossroads of commerce that has replaced tenant farmers with retail stores and residential neighborhoods.</p>
