            <h3>Wilkinsburg, PA Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Wilkinsburg is located in an area of the Appalachian Plateau where various land and water transportation routes join, which historically had been inhabited by Native Americans for thousands of years. Wilkinsburg was formed from the area of a valley going through the hills located east of the three rivers confluence, the Allegheny River, the Monongahela River, and the Ohio River: this natural valley allowed passage by land through the east–west barrier of the Appalachian Mountains to and from the east, whether to or from Philadelphia or other parts of the Atlantic coast, along the rivers (which eventually join the Mississippi River and flow into the Gulf of Mexico), through the Cumberland Gap (to or from the south), or by other transportation routes. A vital section of this major land road or pathway is now known as Penn Avenue, a major street and area of Wilkinsburg.</p>
