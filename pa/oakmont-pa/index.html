            <h3>Oakmont, PA Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Incorporated as a town in 1889, this Allegheny River community began in 1816 when a farmer, Michael Bright, bought a large tract of land 15 miles (24 km) northeast of Pittsburgh. The settlement took its name from a landmark tree, as the deed description reads, 'Beginning at a black oak on the bank of the Allegheny River ...' The borough is best known for the nearby Oakmont Country Club, a premier golf course which has been the site of numerous U.S. Open golf tournaments, including the 2016 U.S. Open.</p>
