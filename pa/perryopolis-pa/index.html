            <h3>Perryopolis, PA Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>George Washington purchased 1,644 acres (6.65 km2) here when land first became available. He visited in 1770 and said, 'as fine a land as I have ever seen, a great deal of rich meadow; it is well watered and has a valuable mill seat.' The mill would eventually be completed in 1776. Once the mill was finished, it encouraged other business to come to the area to support and augment the business of the mill.</p>
