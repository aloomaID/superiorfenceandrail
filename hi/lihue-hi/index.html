                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>In ancient times, Lihue was a minor village. Līhuʻe means 'cold chill' in the Hawaiian language. Lihue is in the ancient district of Puna, the southeastern coast of the island, and the land division (ahupuaʻa) of Kalapaki. Royal Governor Kaikioʻewa officially made it his governing seat in 1837, moving it from Waimea; he named the town after land he owned on Oahu by the same name.</p>
