            <h3>Waipahu, HI Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Waipahu is the name of an artesian spring. In Hawaiian, Waipahu is derived from wai, meaning water, and pahū, meaning 'burst or explode'; combined, Waipahu means 'water forced up (as out of a spring)'. The early Native Hawaiians took pleasure in the cool and clear water gushing from the ground and named this spring Waipahu. Before the Western civilization set foot in Hawaii, the Hawaiians considered Waipahu to be the capital of Oahu. Royalty in the Kingdom of Hawaii would often gather and enjoy the fresh water from the spring Waipahu.</p>
