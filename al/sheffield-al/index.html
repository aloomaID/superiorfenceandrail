            <h3>Sheffield, AL Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Sheffield is a city in Colbert County, Alabama, United States, and is included in the Florence-Shoals metropolitan area. As of the 2010 census, the population of the city was 9,039. Sheffield is the birthplace of 'country-soul pioneer' and songwriter Arthur Alexander, French horn player Willie Ruff, notable attorney, actor, former senator and presidential contender Fred Thompson, Watergate committee U.S. Senator Howell Heflin and U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell, whose father was working in nearby Athens when he was born. It sometimes is referred to as 'the City of Senators' due to the births of Heflin, McConnell and Thompson within its borders. Col. Harland Sanders worked in the Sheffield depot for Southern Railway in the 1907. It is also home to the Muscle Shoals Sound Studio where many popular 20th century musicians recorded their work, including Alexander and Ruff. It is the site of historic Helen Keller Hospital, formerly known as Colbert County Hospital and originally constructed in 1921. It was changed to Helen Keller Hospital in 1979, and Keller's birthplace Ivy Green is located less than one mile southwest of the hospital in adjacent Tuscumbia.</p>
