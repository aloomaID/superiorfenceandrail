Bon Secour is over 35 miles (56 km) due east of the Alabama–Mississippi state line, near Gulf Shores, and over 45 miles (72 km) west of Pensacola, Florida. The name 'Bon Secour' derives from the French phrase meaning 'safe harbor' due to the secluded location on the inside coast of the Fort Morgan peninsula of southern Alabama.</p>
