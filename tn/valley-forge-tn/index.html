            <h3>Valley Forge, TN Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>In 1751, there was a forge at the mouth of the East Valley creek used to convert pig-iron into bar-iron. It was advertised for sale as the property of Daniel Walker, Stephen Evans, and Joseph Williams. It was originally called Mount Joy forge, but it came to be known as Valley Forge. The pig-iron used at Valley Forge was hauled from Warwick furnace. The British burned it in September 1777, and George Washington entrenched the Continental Army in December on the Montgomery County side of Valley creek, opposite Valley Forge. General Washington's headquarters were established at the substantial stone house of Isaac Potts. After the Revolutionary War, another Valley Forge was built on the other side of Valley creek; it was in ruins in 1816.</p>
