            <h3>Balcones Heights, TX Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Balcones Heights is a city in Bexar County, Texas, United States. Its population was 2,746 at the 2020 census, and it was incorporated in 1948. Balcones Heights is an enclave of San Antonio, surrounded entirely by the city, thus some residents and out-of-town visitors erroneously consider it merely a neighborhood of the larger city rather than its own unique community that did so to prevent annexation.</p>
