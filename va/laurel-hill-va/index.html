            <h3>Laurel Hill, VA Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Laurel Hill is a census-designated place in Fairfax County, Virginia, United States. The population as of the 2010 census was 6,855. Formerly part of the Lorton CDP, it comprises most of what was formerly the Lorton Reformatory grounds, which were purchased by Fairfax County in 2002 following the prison's closing and redeveloped as a new suburban community. The name 'Laurel Hill' was adopted from Laurel Hill House, an 18th-century structure which had served as the residence of the Superintendent of the Reformatory, and originally was the home of Revolutionary War patriot William Lindsay.</p>
