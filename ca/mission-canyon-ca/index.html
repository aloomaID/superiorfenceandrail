The canyon itself is one of the most dramatic in the Santa Ynez Mountains with the locally highest peak, La Cumbre Peak 3,988 ft (1,216 m) at the top of the watershed, flanked by Cathedral Peak 3,336 ft (1,017 m) and Arlington Peak 3,258 ft (993 m) to the west, Pine Lookout and Rock Garden to the east, and rugged sandstone formations partially covered with chaparral on both sides of the creek.</p>
