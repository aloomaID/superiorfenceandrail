As of the 2020 census the population was 43,976, making it the third largest city in New Hampshire behind Manchester and Nashua. Governor Benning Wentworth gave the city its current name in 1765 following a boundary dispute with the neighboring town of Bow; the name was meant to signify the new concord, or harmony, between the two towns.</p>
